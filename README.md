### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Vladimir and I am developer at Kontur.
I like interfaces and ui-controls, open-source projects and functional paradigm.
I love 3d-art and game programming for fun.
Currently I learn math (calculus), CS.

You can ask me about frontend stuff, accessability and maybe 3d art things.

I am inspired by Jonathan's Blow [Collapse of Civs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pW-SOdj4Kkk) and [nikitonsky](https://twitter.com/nikitonsky) [Software disenchantment](https://tonsky.me/blog/disenchantment/) and want to do programms easy, faster, less complex.
